From now on every commit log is here because i want it to be here XD
-
Deleted Deathstatus bool var due to useslessness {Player.cs}
+
Win condition check added and that's supposed to stop the game once acomplished, however there's no practical condition yet, so it just exists.{Game.cs}
======================================================
Items is now a thing{Items.cs}
+
Added additional props(...item type, item modifier value, item modifier value) to the class and Water and Whiskey as the first two items.
========================================================
inventory is now a thing. Putting smth into it is checked by Put()::bool.{inventory.cs}
+
added Get(string)::Item which summons an item from a dictionary and removes it{inventory.cs}
+
TotalWeight(void)::int, summation of all items in a dictionary{inventory.cs}
+
FreeWeight(void)::int, returns an amount of free avaliable "kg" of weight, not occupied by items.{inventory.cs}

Honestly no fucking idea on if this stuff works bc it is not testable but we pray they do work (Г_Г) debugging will be fun...
===============================================================
Room has an inventory XDXDXD {Room.cs}
+
GiveToRoom(string)::bool is now a thing. you can place items into the rooms inventory from player's one.
+
TakeFromRoom(string)::bool is born. Allows to move items from room's inventory to player's.
==============================================================================
Working Inventory system
+
You can Grab(Command)::void stuff
+
You can Drop(Command)::void stuff
+
You get a description of items in the room through ShowListOfItems(Inventory,string entry)::string. If your entry states INVENTORY you get only the names of the items(for showing in the inventory duh), also it gets displayed at the terminal for clarity. By any other entry you get a full desc of an item and also entry gets displayed.
=============================================
ModifierUponEntaranceRoom(Room)::void is not a thing anymore. BEHOLD the Ultimate modifier tool: ModifierAppliance(Room,Item,string,Character)::void. Applies a modifier based on the source and target.
+
Inventory entry now gives a type of an item(utility of item for now)
+
Player class became a Character and in Game.cs there is enemy=new Character()
+
UseItem(Command)::void is now a thing. Uses an utility item and applies a modifier respectfully, unless given weapon type is a weapon, then it refers you to first equipping it(WIP)
============================================================
Character is not just a rename it's a base class (wow) and player and hostile are subclasses.
+
Now the showing items in the room system is bind to look command
=====================================
two weapons added
+
EquipItem(Command)::void. equips a weapon if it has corresponding item type.
+
UnequipWeapon(Command)::void. unequips previously equipped weapon.
+
professor is now an enemy and is assigned to the room
===================================================
There is a super sick combat system, however beginning of it is not implemented.
======================================================
unhandeled exception by grabing unspecified item is FIXED( >grab ___ ->exception)
+
end of combat now has a user output
+
Random class used for randomised elements
+
hostile description now goes into the output
+
inventory output is somewhat clearer for the user. [Name]item: modifier{values}. This was implemented so that user knows which commands he has to use.
